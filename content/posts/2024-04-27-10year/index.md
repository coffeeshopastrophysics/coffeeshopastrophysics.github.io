On Friday, April 26th, 2024, CoffeeShop Astrophysics celebrated its 10th anniversary at the Lubar Entrepreneurship Center. What began as a small student-run outreach effort has grown into a decade of connecting Milwaukee with the wonders of astrophysics. The event featured talks from former CSA members Sydney Chamberlain, Laleh Sadeghian, and Casey McGrath, who reflected on the groupâ€™s founding and its journey over the years. It was a night of stories, community, and celebration.
