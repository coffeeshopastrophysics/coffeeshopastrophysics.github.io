  abstract: "Since the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, roughly 14,500 satellites have been launched into orbit around Earth. Currently there are about 11,700 active satellites, roughly 1,100 of which are used for Earth science. These are very powerful tools for studying large scale phenomena on Earth that are hard to observe from Earth's surface. In this talk we'll talk about how scientists use satellite observations for doing research on everything from weather patterns and tectonic plate movement to air pollution and environmental disasters."

  abstract: "Have you ever looked at a stunning picture from NASA full of swirling colors, almost like it should be hanging in an art museum? Chances are, you're looking at a nebula. Nebulae are enormous clouds of dust and gas out in space. Some nebulae are the aftermath of a supernova, the explosive death of a massive star. Others serve as the birthplace of many new stars, formed by the gravitational pull of gas and radiative push of their first stars. Some nebulae even act as both. Join us as we explore nebulae and their role in star formation, and of course, look at many breathtaking pictures."

  abstract: "Are shooting stars really stars falling from the sky? Spoiler alert: they're not! Those quick flashes of light are actually tiny bits of space dust and rock burning up in our atmosphere. In this talk, we'll take a journey through the leftovers of the formation of our Solar System: asteroids, meteorites, and comets. We'll talk about how these cosmic “crumbs” sometimes light up our skies as meteor showers, how a rock you could hold in your hand might be older than the Earth itself, and how one very big space rock may have changed the path of life's evolution on Earth by wiping out the dinosaurs."

  abstract: "Over the last century, computing in science has changed from human computers doing calculations by hand to supercomputers that can perform over 10^18 (that's 1,000,000,000,000,000,000!) operations per second. This exponential growth in computing power has enabled the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms (often referred to as artificial intelligence) capable of analyzing data, recognizing patterns, and making predictions in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. But what even is AI, and how do scientists utilize these evolving technologies? From computing history, to modern environmental and ethical concerns, join us to learn “What You Probably Don't Know About AI”!"

  abstract: "On 11 March 2011, Japan was hit by an earthquake, 9.1 on the Richter scale, which triggered a 15 meter high tsunami. This chain of events resulted in a nuclear meltdown that lasted for several days, now referred as the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Why did this happen? And more generally, why and how does any earthquake, tsunami, or even a volcanic eruption happen? Understanding these natural calamities entails understanding the structure and dynamical evolution of the Earth. From stardust, 4.6 billion years ago to a highly structured planet arranged by a core, a mantle, and a crust in the present day, the evolution of our planet hides many interesting secrets essential for life. Join us on February 22 at Anodyne as we dive into the science behind the formation of our planet, its current day structure, and its continuous movement resulting in the formation of continents."

At the poles, where the field is the strongest, fast moving particles from the sun crash into the atmosphere creating a dazzling light show. Auroras have captivated humanity for a long time.

Beyond its cultural significance, the Sun's energy is fundamental to life on Earth, driving climate, weather, and photosynthesis. As the dominant force in the solar system, it dictates planetary orbits and space weather. In this talk, we will explore its structure and composition, its different types of activity, and its ultimate fate as it evolves and eventually dies."

While it may seem like just a tiny blob of light against the night sky, Andromeda, along with billions of other galaxies in our universe, contain hundreds of billions of stars as well as more powerful compact objects lurking deep within their cores. Galaxies come in all shapes and sizes and reveal much about the dynamics and structure of our universe. Come to our talk and learn all about galaxies, from their humble beginnings to their strange and mysterious ends, and everything in between!"

  abstract: "Volcanoes are some of the most spectacular and powerful forces shaping planetary landscapes. They not only sculpt the surface but also influence the atmosphere and potential habitability of a world. In our own solar system, Jupiter's moon Io stands out as the most volcanically active body. Its surface is a constantly changing tapestry, driven by interior tidal stresses that cover its surface in volcanic craters. In this talk, we'll embark on a journey from Io's changing landscape to the surfaces of distant planets orbiting other stars. We'll explore how the same tidal forces that energize Io might also ignite volcanoes on worlds far beyond our solar system. Specifically, we'll delve into the intriguing L 98-59 system, where Earth-sized planets may be experiencing their own volcanic activity due to similar gravitational interactions that occur in the Io-Jupiter system."

  abstract: "Satellites have become essential to modern life, even if we don’t always realize it. They enable remote communication, give us navigation directions on demand, assist in climate research, and can even be used as tools to uncover the mysteries of the Universe. But once they're in space, how long do they stay operational, and what happens when they stop working? With so many satellites orbiting Earth, what happens when it gets too crowded? These questions have been a core point in the development of international “Space Law.” Join us as we explore the fascinating world of satellites — their purpose, their risks, and how we manage the growing challenge of space debris."

  abstract: "In 1950 during a lunchtime conversation at Los Alamos National Laboratory, physicist Enrico Fermi asked “where is everybody?“. Fermi then went on to estimate that given the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and probability of Earth-like planets, we should have been contacted by extraterrestrials by then. If the universe is so vast, why do we seem to be alone in it? What about the “Wow!” signal or that face on Mars? Maybe we have had contact and just don’t know it! Join us to discuss extraterrestrial signals, unexplained phenomena, and the relationship between science and the public when it comes to the search for extraterrestrial life."

Now 10 years later, we have given over 75 public talks at the Anodyne coffeeshop in Walker's Point and seen dozens of UWM graduate students and postdocs participate. Most importantly we have seen our audience grow to include a mix of long-time attendees as well as many newcomers just discovering our talk series. We are excited to welcome back three past members of Coffeeshop Astrophysics who were integral to its growth and development. They will share with you all the cool work, scientific or otherwise, that they have been up to since leaving UWM. We want to sincerely thank each and every one of you for your support over the past 10 years, and we look forward to 10 more years of sharing science with you and the greater Milwaukee community."

Gravitational waves were first discovered in a groundbreaking detection by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO). The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, some potentially habitable, helped expand the horizons of planetary science. There were also enormous advancements in space technology and instrumentation such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which in only a couple of years has completely transformed our understanding of the universe both near and far. In this talk we will review the exciting discoveries and scientific improvements of the last decade and talk about what we hope to accomplish in the next ten years!"
